    <p id="para-style">According to Clark College, pre-writing activities for an opinion paragraph include choosing a controversial
        issue that lends itself to agreement and disagreement. Writers need to pick a side, but also research both sides
        of the issue.

        The Paragraph Organizer website suggests using an outline to organize the points of the paragraph. The paragraph
        must include the main idea stated in a single sentence, typically the topic sentence. The opinion paragraph
        should also include more than one point that supports the stated opinion. The strongest supporting point should
        come first. Each point should include an example or some other additional support.

        An effective opinion paragraph also includes a refutation, or a statement of the opposing viewpoint. Clark
        College suggests putting the refutation near the end of the paragraph, which is then finished with a concluding
        statement that answers the refutation.

        Paragraph Organizer suggests checking the paragraph right away for grammar and spelling mistakes as well as
        ensuring the style and organization is optimal. It is often a good idea to wait some time before completing the
        final edit of the paragraph.</p>
